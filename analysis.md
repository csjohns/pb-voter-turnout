However in the database, we have 49 unique District IDs in the pulled file. (not sure what this is about - people moving? data error? ideas, Sonya?) In the table, I've counted how many entries we have *total* for each district in the *original* import file, how many in the *original* file we *matched*, and how many we have in the *current* file.
