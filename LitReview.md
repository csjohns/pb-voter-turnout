## Social pressure on voting

**Gerber et al. (2008)** find that social pressure increases voter turnout. Comparing voting record to that of neighbors is as effective as face-to-face canvassing - it increases the turnout by about 8%.

They show this with an experiment that sent 4 types of mailers to prospective voters:

* One said voting was a civic duty
* One said researchers would look at public records
* One received record of turnout in a household
* One received record of turnout and neighbors' turnout

The mechanism is through the influence of *norms* (of voting). But in order for norms to work, you have to:

* Be aware that they exist and recognize them (citizens are expected to vote)
* Internalize them as proper and applicable, even if they impose costs (some feel a strong sense of obligation for civic duties)
* They must be enforced (sanctions against non-voting may or may not happen)

The *calculus of voting* is split the utility of voting for *intrinsic* (people vote for their own satisfaction) and *extrinsic* (people vote because other people see them voting) benefits. The more likely that people know your voting record, the higher it multiplies the extrinsic benefits. If the intrinsic benefits plus the extrinsic benefits outweigh the costs of voting, then people should vote. Thus manipulating the benefits (such as by reminding people that there is intrinsic value to voting, or that others will know you did or didn't vote), should increase the likelihood of voting.

## Individual factors for voting

Some have thought that residential mobility makes people less likely to vote, since it requires re-registration. **Denny and Doyle (2009)** find that while more residential mobility decreases the likelihood of voting when people first become eligible to vote, it doesn't have much of an effect for subsequent voting.

## Habitual voting

**Plutzer (2002)** says that people usually habitual voters or habitual non-voters. In general, people start out as habitual non-voters, partly because younger voters face high costs to entry (registration, no knowledge of how to do it, etc). People generally move from being habitual non-voters to being habitual voters. 

There is an *inertia* for voting or not-voting. Things that can disrupt that inertia are things like residental moves (which require re-registration). There is an *initial level of voting* (when did you first vote) and *inertia* (how likely are you to keep voting). Some factors affect the initial level of voting (parents, education, etc). 

**Denny and Doyle (2009)** find that indeed voting in a previous election increases the probability of voting in a subsequent election, but this effect is decreased when accounting for "initial conditions" - a propensity to vote before one is eligible. These initial conditions help distinguish people who may have a higher propensity to vote when they are first eligible. They use the longitudinal British National Childhoot Development Survey. They estimate the effect of lagged voter turnout for a naive model, they then re-estimate the model with the error term that acccounts for the probability of voting when first eligible. With this, the effect of people's voting habit (lagged voting) on later voter turnout decreased from 26% to 13%. The implications for this are that investments in political education prior to voting eligibility may have a positive effect of future voter turnout when first eligible, which can help with habit formation for later voting.

## Institutional factors for voting

*Age* and *rules that facilitate voting* affect turnout **(Blais 2006)**. **Franklin (1996)** says that turnout is higher when voting takes place on Sunday. **Franklin (2004)** says that impacts on turnout due to some change should be felt mostly by new cohorts, who haven't yet developed a habit of voting (or abstaining). Also says that the *degree of electoral competition* is the most crucial determinant of turnout.

**Beck and Heideman (2014)** look at the history of *party mobilization* of voters. Whereas previously parties used to conduct voter turnout efforts broadly, now parties focus on states they are likely to win. Voter contacts by GOTV efforts grew from '56-'72, but then declined until '92. Then they rose sharply, before tapering off after '04. There used to be local party organizations who would try to mobilize local voters. Now potential voters are mobilized not because they live by a strong local party, but because they live in a battleground state. Therefore it is suggested that national politics rather than local are driving voter outreach.
