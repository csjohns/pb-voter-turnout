## Social pressure on voting

**Gerber et al. (2008)** find that social pressure increases voter turnout. Comparing voting record to that of neighbors is as effective as face-to-face canvassing - it increases the turnout by about 8%.

They show this with an experiment that sent 4 types of mailers to prospective voters:

* One said voting was a civic duty
* One said researchers would look at public records
* One received record of turnout in a household
* One received record of turnout and neighbors' turnout

The mechanism is through the influence of norms (of voting). But in order for norms to work, you have to:

* Be aware that they exist and recognize them (citizens are expected to vote)
* Internalize them as proper and applicable, even if they impose costs (some feel a strong sense of obligation for civic duties)
* They must be enforced (sanctions against non-voting may or may not happen)

The *calculus of voting* is split the utility of voting for intrinsic (people vote for their own satisfaction) and extrinsic (people vote because other people see them voting) benefits. The more likely that people know your voting record, the higher it multiplies the extrinsic benefits. If the intrinsic benefits plus the extrinsic benefits outweigh the costs of voting, then people should vote. Thus manipulating the benefits (such as by reminding people that there is intrinsic value to voting, or that others will know you did or didn't vote), should increase the likelihood of voting.
